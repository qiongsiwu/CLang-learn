# CLang
Programming examples and exercises for the C Programming Language
I am going back to the basics and teach myself the C language. I'd want to do it systematically. 

The programs are made and tested on Ubuntu Linux. For examples in the book, I aim at preserving the originality, with occasional omission on some comments. Compiling with clang may give warning because the main usually does not have a return type. However, all compile warnings are fixed for the exercises.
